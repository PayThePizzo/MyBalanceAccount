# MyBalanceAccount
The best way to understand our expenses is to save them and analyze them a-posteriori.

## Premises
This project has been made with the purpose of practicing specific technologies, frameworks and IDEs such as:
* Java, pgSQL, Html, Javascript
* Gradle, Spring
* Intellij IDEA, Datagrip
* PgAdmin 4

## The Core Idea
The application has three main parts:
* Web User Interface
* MVC 
* Local Database

Each one of them has a specific behavior and task.
The Web UI is used by the local user to add/remove/edit/ data from the database. The user can display in a fancy way, any information they are looking for.
The MVC allows the user to process their requests and receive an appropriate response.
Data is stored in the local databased and accessed with specific queries.
